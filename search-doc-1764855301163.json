For those interested, you can examine the pixi.toml file to see how dependencies are specified and to explore the available Pixi tasks for Momentum.  info If you choose not to use Pixi, you will need to manually install all dependencies using platform-specific package managers.

Throwing exceptions allows error detection mechanisms to have visibility into these errors and prevents silent failures, which may lead to more severe bugs. By choosing exceptions as the primary method for error handling in Momentum, we ensure that unrecoverable errors are easily detectable, and the Momentum library remains user-friendly for developers interacting with the application layer.  Using exceptions is especially crucial when considering the application layer as the user of the Momentum library. For layers closer to the services, everything should be surrounded by try-catch blocks to prevent server crashes while still providing valuable error information. Python programmers, who often interact with the application layer, typically expect exceptions, making it a more reasonable approach for error handling in Momentum.  One important caution is to avoid using exceptions for flow control; common errors, such as &quot;L2 norm is too high,&quot; should not result in exceptions being thrown.

The [] operator does not perform bounds checking, thus offering better performance.

Library Implementation Source Files (Use Quotes &quot;&quot;)​  In library implementation source files (.cpp files in core library directories), use quotes:  // In library implementation .cpp files #include &quot;momentum/character/character.h&quot; #include &quot;momentum/common/checks.h&quot;   Rationale: Quotes instruct the compiler to first search in local/relative directories before falling back to system paths.

Pymomentum's rasterizer uses the pymomentum.renderer.Camera class. You can construct one in a few ways:  You can construct a camera with an intrinsics model and optional extrinsics matrix.If you have a pymomentum body model, you can use pymomentum.renderer.build_cameras_for_body() to create a camera that looks at the body and frames it in view.You can construct a default camera and set the extrinsics matrix explicitly, using e.g. camera.look_at().You can use camera.frame() to frame a set of 3d points in view (this can be handy for ensuring that an entire animation stays in frame).  Note that the camera determines the image resolution, you can always use camera.upsample() to scale up the image as needed for better quality.  import pymomentum.renderer as pym_renderer import numpy as np image_height, image_width = 800, 1000 # Create a pinhole intrinsics model intrinsics = pym_renderer.PinholeIntrinsicsModel( image_width=image_width, image_height=image_height, fx=800.0, # focal length in pixels fy=800.0, cx=image_width / 2.0, # principal point cy=image_height / 2.0 ) # Create a camera with the intrinsics camera = pym_renderer.Camera(intrinsics) # Move the camera along -z and look at the origin camera = camera.look_at( position=np.array([0, 0, 1]), target=np.zeros(3), up=np.array([0, 1, 0]) ) # Make sure the entire object is in view: camera = camera.frame(vertex_positions)   Depth/Image buffers​  Now you need to create depth and RGB buffers to render onto. This is very easy now that you have a camera.  import pymomentum.renderer as pym_renderer z_buffer = pym_renderer.create_z_buffer(camera) rgb_buffer = pym_renderer.create_rgb_buffer(camera)   Note: the buffer size will get padded out to the nearest multiple of 8 for better SIMD performance.

We can use the z buffer to correct this, but if we try to rasterize the skeleton to the same image where the mesh is the skeleton will be completely hidden.
